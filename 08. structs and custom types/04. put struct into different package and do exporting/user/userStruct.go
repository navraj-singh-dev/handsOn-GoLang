// A single struct with its methods and data can be put into a single standalone
// package of its own. Now this package can be used in other packages across the moduele.

// But creating a new package for structs and its methods|data can create new challenges
// remember the captial letter to export anything out of the package (struct, methods, variables etc.)

// structs when exported outside of package do not export their fields üòê
// to expose their fields one must export their fields also.. use the capital letter
// for every field you want to export. It goes the same for methods and variables and any other things.

// On a side note do not export the struct's fields just use a constructor funtion to return the 
// struct instance instead.

// In packages the constructor funtion is just named "New". Because in other packages using the
// consturctor function as user.NewUser() look just weird but user.New() looks good. So every golang
// develoer just names their constructor as "New" for every package they might create.

// In other packages the constructor function is used to create the struct instance, the
// old way of refering to the name of the struct and then adding value do not work as fields
// are probhibited to exporting.
